# Movie Poster Test

## Instructions
Starting with this endpoint: 

API: https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/popular?api_key=d0f5f2e135336200362af8a1a73acb17

Please build a react native app that does the following:

**Home Screen**
Fetch a list of popular movies and display their posters in a list. For each poster that is rendered, create a UI element that allows me to like or unlike that movie. 

A movie that has been liked should indicate that visually. 

**Liked Screen**
Render the movie posters from the list of Liked movies. 

**Navigation**
Provide a simple way to move between the two routes 

**BONUS POINTS:**
- don’t put any operation that is non-presentational in a component 
- show clean code 
- show custom hooks 
- show me a pixel perfect user interface
